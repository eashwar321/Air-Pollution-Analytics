Analysing the Air Pollution levels for India

Air pollution in India is a serious issue with the major sources being fuelwood and biomass burning, fuel adulteration, vehicle emission and traffic congestion. In autumn and winter months, large scale crop residue burning in agriculture fields – a low cost alternative to mechanical tilling – is a major source of smoke, smog and particulate pollution. India has a low per capita emissions of greenhouse gases but the country as a whole is the third largest after China and the United States.A 2013 study on non-smokers has found that Indians have 30% lower lung function compared to Europeans.

The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act was passed in 1981 to regulate air pollution and there have been some measurable improvements. However, the 2016 Environmental Performance Index ranked India 141 out of 180 countries.

The dataset comprises of various information regarding the air pollutant levels across various states and cities present in India. The air pollutants included in the dataset are: No2, So2, Rspm, Spm, Pm2_5. The dataset had many duplicates and null values. Python was used to clean and pre process the dataset. The trends and figures of various pollutants were analysed by plotting interactive graphs using tableau. Later, time series forecasting machine learning models were created to predict the future air pollutnat values for various states and cities present in India.
